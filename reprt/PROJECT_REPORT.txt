CONCLUSION
================================================================================

This melanoma detection system demonstrates the potential of AI in medical
screening and early detection of skin cancer. By combining U-Net segmentation
with ResNet50 classification, we achieve a robust 90.45% overall accuracy.

The integration of an AI-powered chatbot provides patients with immediate
access to information and guidance, while maintaining appropriate medical
safety boundaries.

While the system shows promising results, it is designed as a screening tool
to assist healthcare professionals, not replace them. All suspicious lesions
should be evaluated by qualified dermatologists.
